Here’s a sample README you can use for your recipe app:

Recipe App

Features
1. Recipe Search: Search for various dishes and view their details.
2. Recipe Details: View ingredients, preparation steps, and related information for each recipe.
3. State Management: Uses React's Context API for managing global state.
4. Navigation: React Router is used for navigating between pages.
5. Customization: Styled with Material UI components.

Technologies Used
1. React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. React Router: For navigation between different pages.
3. Material UI: For responsive, customizable UI components.
4. Context API: For managing and sharing state across the app.

# React + Vite


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
